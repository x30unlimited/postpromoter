# Promobot software

## Note

This is a fork of postpromoter but it does not modify any of the original features.


## Additional Features

### Encrypted memos
All incoming requests (vote bids, reversal requests...) can be can now be both encrypted or unencrypted. 

Upon encrypted transfers, postpromoter will always answer encrypting the memo. The postpromoter mechanic downstream will behave normally once memo is decrypted with the bidbot account memo key.

Encrypted memo is enabled out-of-the-box. **No configuration required**.

### Sell Accounts
Allow users and dApps to purchase accounts* on behalf of your account. Discounted claimed accounts are needed in order to sell accounts (see feature auto discounted account claiming).

Enable account selling in config.json under the boolean `account_creation_enabled`.

Set a price for each account creation (in USD) under `create_account_price_usd`(In case more funds are sent, the system will automatically send leftovers along with the confirmation).

The memo *keyword* is **"createaccount"** followed by the new account name, and lastly followed by the owner public key, active public key, posting public key and memo public key (respectively). 

**Please note the 4 keys are required; in case same public key is desired for all auths just repeat it in the memo.**

Account creation transfer memo request can be encrypted.

Transfer Memo example (encrypted): 
```
#createaccount test.account STM7UkRnx6h2oumyYCRBkZYaUZqikyjiFGFvJ8i5vKCnQmCRC8D8W STM7UkRnx6h2oumyYCRBkZYaUZqikyjiFGFvJ8i5vKCnQmCRC8D8W STM7UkRnx6h2oumyYCRBkZYaUZqikyjiFGFvJ8i5vKCnQmCRC8D8W STM7UkRnx6h2oumyYCRBkZYaUZqikyjiFGFvJ8i5vKCnQmCRC8D8W 
```

(*) *No account recovery support is given*

### Auto discounted account claiming
Since bidbots account will usually sit on large amounts of SP, it is often convenient to expend RC (resource credits) on new accounts.

Enable it under `account_claim_enabled`and set a refresh rate at `claimAccountCountdown`in hours.

**In order to avoid depleting temporarily your account Resource Credits (RC) it is recommeded to set a conservative `claimAccountCountdown`value at first**

### Reverse votes
Bidbot owners can now set a price for a vote reversal. For instance, *accountA* bids for vote on one of its posts. Then *accountB* sends a vote reversal request for *accountA* post. 
*AccountB* can pay a fraction of the original bid amount paid by *accountA*.

First, enable the reversal in config file (config.json), setting `reversal_enabled` to `true`. 

Second, define a reversal price. For example, 20% of original bid price, set `reversal_price` in config file as `0.20`.
Users will simply send encrypted memos along with the bid with the keyword **"reverse"** before post URL. 

Vote reversal transfer memo request can be encrypted.

Transfer Memo example (encrypted): 
```
#reverse https://steemit/@example/my-example-post-to-reversal 
```
(notice the space between 'reverse' and 'post URL')

#### Steemconnect hot signing links (HSL)
For ease of use, your postpromoter instance will post a HSL on the upvoted post comment. This way, users can easily access the reversal feature without manual transfers. 

With HSL all you need to do is clicking on the link and, when prompted, authenticating via steemconnect.

### Mocha test Module
Tests will target both original and new features making sure your instance and configuration are ready for production. For testing purposes, the test account will post a test-post for testing operations (voting, unvoting etc..)
**Among the tests, these are some of the currently available:**
* Memo encryption / decryption
* dsteem Asynchronous client requests
* Bid for vote under min_bid and confirming a refund
* Bid for vote and confirming vote
* Check via blockchain that refunds have been properly sent
* Sending above vote-reversal price and confirming leftovers have been properly refunded
* Check vote reversal has been succesfully un-casted

**Important: If you want to run tests before production (recommended) please make sure to set in config file a testing account (testing account will serve a a fake/dummy account for bidding and requesting vote reversal)**

```

### Blacklist
You can add a list users whose bids will not be accepted and who will not receive any refund by adding their Steem account to the "blacklist" file. Set the "blacklist_location" property to point to the location of your blacklist file, or you can use a URL to point to a shared blacklist on the internet. The file should contain only one steem account name on each line and nothing else as in the following example:

```
blacklisted_account_1
blacklisted_account_2
blacklisted_account_3
```

Additionally you can add a list of "flag_signal_accounts" which means that if any accounts on that list have flagged the post at the time the bid is sent then the bot will treat it as blacklisted.

## Run
```
$ nodejs postpromoter.js
```

This will run the process in the foreground which is not recommended. We recommend using a tool such as [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to run the process in the background as well as providing many other great features.

## API Setup
If you would like to use the API functionality set the "api.enabled" setting to "true" and choose a port. You can test if it is working locally by running:

```
$ curl http://localhost:port/api/bids
```

If that returns a JSON object with bids then it is working.

It is recommended to set up an nginx reverse proxy server (or something similar) to forward requests on port 80 to the postpromoter nodejs server. For instructions on how to do that please see: https://medium.com/@utkarsh_verma/configure-nginx-as-a-web-server-and-reverse-proxy-for-nodejs-application-on-aws-ubuntu-16-04-server-872922e21d38

In order to be used on the bot tracker website it will also need an SSL certificate. For instructions to get and install a free SSL certificate see: https://certbot.eff.org/
